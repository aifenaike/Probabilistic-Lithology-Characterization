# Probabilistic-Lithology-Characterization-ML

The accurate predicting of the lithology is essential to optimize all drilling parameters and to minimize the drilling cost. Various methods have been used previously for predicting lithology using well log data. However, the use of drilling data for lithology predicting received only a little attention. Here, I have developed an Random Forest model to determine the probability of the existence of certain lithofacies as a function of drilling data (i.e. depth (D), rate of penetration (ROP), drilling mud flow rate (GPM), drill string rotation speed (RPM), weight on bit (WOB), stand pipe pressure (SP), total nozzle flow area (TFA), and bit size (BS))
